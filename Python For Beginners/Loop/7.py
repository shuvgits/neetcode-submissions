# Given a list of numbers, iterate through it and print numbers that satisfy these conditions:

# The number must be divisible by five.
# If the number is greater than 150, skip it and move to the next.
# If the number is greater than 500, stop the loop entirely.

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for item in numbers:
    # Condition 3: Stop the loop if number > 500
    if item > 500:
        break
    
    # Condition 2: Skip the number if > 150
    if item > 150:
        continue
    
    # Condition 1: Print if divisible by 5
    if item % 5 == 0:
        print(item)
